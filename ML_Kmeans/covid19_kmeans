ML Approach to the Dataset with k-means clustering:

Step 1: 
Reading the covid data from s3 bucket
 
Step 2:
Considering the necessary dimensions(mobile, distance) in the data frame and determining the optimal k value for clustering by using elbow method. 

Step 3: 
clustering based on the total distance travelled by an individual patient
 
Step 4: 
Getting the cluster label for every distinct mobile number
 
Step 5: 
Clustering the entire dataset
 
Step 6 : 
visualizing the clusters
 
Step 7: 
Plotting the points on map where the patient travelled and colouring the patient points based on their cluster
Identifying the maximum patient visited areas or affected regions in heatmap
